# Grunt
http://gruntjs.com/

In one word: automation.

The less work you have to do when performing repetitive tasks like minification, compilation, unit testing, linting, etc, the easier your job becomes. After you've configured it through a Gruntfile, a task runner can do most of that mundane work for you—and your team—with basically zero effort.

## Install
npm install -g grunt-cli

## Plugins
http://gruntjs.com/plugins

Was hoping to play with BrowserSync today but didn't have time.

=================

# Gulp
http://gulpjs.com/

gulp's use of streams and code-over-configuration makes for a simpler and more intuitive build.

## Install
$ npm install --global gulp

# Broccoli
https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli

A fast, reliable asset pipeline, supporting constant-time rebuilds and compact build definitions. Comparable to the Rails asset pipeline in scope, though it runs on Node and is backend-agnostic.

## Install
npm install --save-dev broccoli
npm install --global broccoli-cli
